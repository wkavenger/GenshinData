The brilliant lightning reaches out across Inazuma, displaying the eternal path of our Almighty Narukami Ogosho to the distant seas and spreading her name across the lands.
Your devoted servant, Kujou Takayuki of the Tenryou Commission, humbly submits this memorandum.
The Vision Hunt Decree proceeds without obstacles. O Almighty Ogosho, at your mercy and might all delusions waste away, those who have fled return, and all your people welcome the inspections, indeed, even in their hearts.
All Inazuma is at peace thanks to your divine power, You Excellency.
