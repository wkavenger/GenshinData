Birds of a Feather
In the near future, a meeting of thieves will take place in the underground tunnels beneath Inazuma City.
The meeting is expected to take place late in the night, ending some time before dawn.
There are two parties to this meeting. One consists of traitors from within our own ranks who are stealing army supplies to line their own pockets.
The other is gangs of thieves and smugglers that have formed in recent years.

Send in the Shiyuumatsu to end traitors and criminals alike.
