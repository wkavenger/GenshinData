# GenshinData
Repository containing the data for the live version of Genshin Impact. This repository is a work between [FZFalzar](https://github.com/FZFalzar) and I.

~~As of update 1.6.0 performed on the 6/7/2021 there might be wrong names or inconsistency on specific or rare fields, more specifically when there's not enough data to analyze and will mostly be seen on boolean fields. Due to the nature of the process we use to dump stuff there's not much that can be done.~~ This will be improved in the following days, too overworked right now. BinOutput will probably be updated again too, but still stripped of some useless/irrelevant content.
